Now working for playing.

If you have Mac, this game works easily. 

1. Download these files.
2. Drag app.rb to your Terminal.app.
3. Press return key.
4. It works! (maybe you should set Terminal.app's window as large as you can)

When you have some interestings to this program, change Settings file and run again.
Have fun :>
